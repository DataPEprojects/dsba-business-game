# Client-Side Test Terminal (Deprecated)

This was a test file for testing client-side features in the terminal. We decided to keep it for future reference, but it is **no longer used** in the current project, even in the official V0.

## Reason for Deprecation

The main reason is that the number of variables and configurations needed to simulate a complete game is too high to be managed efficiently in a simple terminal test script.

Additionally, development has moved towards a more modular and object-oriented architecture, making this type of test less relevant.

## Current Approach

V0 now includes web pages to test features in a more interactive and visual way.
